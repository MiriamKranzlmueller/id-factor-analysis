# Matching Criterion for Identifiability in Sparse Factor Analysis

The matching criterion and its extension are implented in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). To install the required R-packages, run:

```         
Rscript requirements.R
```


Deciding generig sign-identifiability via computer algebra requires [SageMath](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html). To install the required Python-packages, run:

```         
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


To reproduce the experimental results in the paper, run:
```
bash experiments/experiment1/run.sh
bash experiments/experiment2/run.sh
bash experiments/experiment3/run.sh
```
